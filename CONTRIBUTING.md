Contributing to gopher-games
========================================

* We use github-flow - create a branch from master, e.g. new-feature
* Pull requests must contain a succinct, clear summary of what the user need is driving this feature change
* Ensure your branch contains logical atomic commits before sending a pull request - follow the [alphagov Git styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
* You may rebase your branch after feedback if it's to include relevant updates from the develop branch, but it's not necessary.
